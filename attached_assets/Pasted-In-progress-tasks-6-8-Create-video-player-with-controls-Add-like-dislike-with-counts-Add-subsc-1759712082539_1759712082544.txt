I'll help you complete the project import migration. Let me start by checking the current state of the project and the workflow logs to understand what needs to be done.

Decided on project next steps (6 seconds)
I understand! You have an incomplete YouTube-like application called CineWeave. Based on your attached file, Tasks 1-7 were completed (logo improvement, database schema extensions, and API endpoints), but Tasks 8-15 (frontend features) are still pending. You want me to:

First create a comprehensive task list
Complete all missing features to make it fully functional like YouTube
Ensure high quality throughout
Let me start by understanding the current state of the project and then build a complete task list.


Opened replit.md

Opened shared/schema.ts

Searched for "What pages and components exist in the client? What is the current structure of the frontend?"

Decided on remaining frontend tasks (10 seconds)
Perfect! I can see the project status clearly. The database schema and API endpoints (Tasks 1-7) are completed. Now I need to complete Tasks 8-15 which are all frontend features. Let me examine the current Watch page and create a comprehensive task list.


Planned video viewing page development (10 seconds)
Excellent! Now I have a complete understanding. Let me create a comprehensive task list for all remaining work and then execute everything systematically.


Decided on task execution order (6 seconds)
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive 8-task plan to complete CineWeave. Let me start executing these tasks systematically. First, I'll ensure the database schema is pushed, then build all the frontend features, create seed data, and test everything.

Let me start by pushing the database schema to ensure all tables are ready:


Marked Task 7 completed: not applicable (5 seconds)
Perfect! The database schema has been pushed successfully. All tables are now in the database. Let me mark Task 7 as completed and move to the next task.

Now I need to complete the frontend features. Let me mark Task 7 as completed and then delegate the frontend work to subagents. Since these are all frontend tasks that are related, I should delegate them efficiently.

Looking at the task execution guidelines:

I should use start_subagent to complete tasks
I need to call architect to review my changes before marking as complete
I should maximize parallel tool calls
Let me mark Task 7 as completed_pending_review first, then move to tasks 1-5 which are all frontend features. I'll delegate these to a subagent.

Actually, looking at the guidelines more carefully:

I should call architect to review changes
For Task 7, there were no code changes, just running a command, so architect review might not be applicable
I should mark it as completed with architect_reviewed: "not_applicable"
Let me do that.

Excellent! Database schema is successfully pushed. Let me mark Task 7 as complete and move to building the frontend features.


Add all necessary data tables

Planned Watch page component development (9 seconds)
Perfect! Task 7 is completed. Now I'm on Task 1 which is marked as in_progress. I need to build a video player component with HTML5 video element and controls.

According to the task execution guidelines, I should:

Delegate this task to a subagent using start_subagent
Then call architect to review the changes
Then mark as completed
However, looking at the tasks, Tasks 1-5 are all related frontend features that should be built together in the Watch page. It would be more efficient to delegate all of them together as one comprehensive task.

Let me think about this:

Task 1: Video player component
Task 2: Like/dislike functionality
Task 3: Subscribe functionality
Task 4: Comment section
Task 5: Related videos sidebar
All of these are part of the Watch page functionality. I should delegate all of them together to a subagent to build a complete, functional Watch page.

Let me read the relevant files that the subagent will need to work with, then delegate the comprehensive task.

Actually, looking at the guidelines, I should complete tasks one at a time and mark them as completed before moving to the next. But since all these tasks are tightly coupled (they're all part of the Watch page), it makes more sense to do them together.

Let me think about this differently:

I could delegate Task 1 alone (video player)
Then Task 2 (like/dislike)
Then Task 3 (subscribe)
Then Task 4 (comments)
Then Task 5 (related videos)
But this would be inefficient because each task would require modifying the same Watch.tsx file multiple times.

I think the best approach is to delegate all frontend tasks (1-5) together as one comprehensive task to the subagent. This is more efficient and creates a cohesive Watch page.

Let me delegate a comprehensive task to build the complete Watch page with all features.

Now let me delegate building the complete Watch page with all interactive features. Since Tasks 1-5 are all related to the Watch page, I'll handle them together for efficiency.


Implementing YouTube-like watch page

Decided on Watch page features
Let me wait for the subagent to complete building the Watch page with all the interactive features...


Opened client/src/pages/Watch.tsx

Decided on Watch.tsx features
Great! The subagent has successfully updated the Watch page. Let me check the complete implementation and verify it's working properly.


Planned next steps and review (7 seconds)
Excellent! The Watch page has been completely rebuilt with all interactive features. Let me see the complete UI implementation:


Opened client/src/pages/Watch.tsx

Decided on next development steps (6 seconds)
Perfect! The Watch page is now fully functional with all features. Let me call the architect to review all the changes before marking tasks complete:


Reviewed watch page implementation

"Checked server routes for issues" (4 seconds)
The architect found critical issues! The frontend doesn't match the backend API contract. Let me fix these immediately:


Decided on route authentication strategy (6 seconds)
I can see the subscription DELETE route actually accepts a body (lines 203-217), so that part should work. Let me check the authentication middleware and comment routes to understand the issues better:


Delegated authentication and error handling tasks (9 seconds)
I can see the issues now. Most API routes don't have authentication middleware (isAuthenticated), which is a security concern. Let me delegate fixing these critical issues:


Secured API routes and improved frontend error handling

Planned next development steps
Excellent! The subagent has fixed all the critical issues. Let me verify the changes and call the architect to review:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on next development steps
Perfect! The server is running smoothly. Now let me call the architect to review the authentication and error handling fixes:


Reviewing Agent's code

Called architect again
Let me try the architect review again:


Reviewed authentication and error handling fixes

Decided on ownership checks
Critical security issue found! Comments and playlists can be edited/deleted by any user. Let me fix this immediately:


Fixed authorization bypass vulnerability

Decided on reviewing security fix
Excellent! The authorization vulnerability has been fixed. Let me verify the changes and get architect approval:

Checked console and system logs

Verified server and authorization security
Perfect! Server is running smoothly. Let me call the architect to review the authorization fixes:


Verified authorization fixes for comment and playlist routes

Decided on task completion status (4 seconds)
Perfect! The architect has approved all the security fixes. The Watch page is now complete and secure. Let me mark Tasks 1-5 as completed and move to creating seed data:
